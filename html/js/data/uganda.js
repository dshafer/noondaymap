He soon left her.  Coral was stranded with no work, no food, and she didn't have friends or family in town.  We shared the story of God's love with Coral and she now loves God and isn't jumping from man to man.  She is earning money to provide for her children and she has become the most hardworking member of our team.  And she has mastered the red, Kampala with Love Necklace, which is the most difficult to create because the beads are so small.",
